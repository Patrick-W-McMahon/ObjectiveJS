It will work along side other libraries like JQuery with no problems. some of the files are plug-able by them self. but you will need core, and math for a basic install. \r\n\r\n* **core.o.js** holds core functions for inheritance and other basic functions that are attached to the function and object.\r\n\r\n* **math.o.js** extends the math functions and adds new ones that are needed.\r\n\r\n* **geo.o.js** adds functions that have to do with geography calculations. Most of the calculations have to do with latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\n* **array.o.js** extends the functions for the array object.\r\n\r\n* **string.o.js** extends the functions for the string object.\r\n\r\n* **misc.o.js** a bunch of miscellaneous functions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
