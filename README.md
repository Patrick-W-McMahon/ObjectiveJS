ObjectiveJS
===========

an OOP Javascript library that make javascript work more like c++/Java
=======
ObjectiveJS is meant to add more functions to base objects in the core JavaScript framework. It will work along side other libraries like JQuery with no problems. some of the files are plug-able by them self. but you will need core, and math for a basic install.


core.o.js holds core functions for inheritance and other basic functions that are attached to the function and object.

math.o.js extends the math functions and adds new ones that are needed.

geo.o.js adds functions that have to do with geographical calculations. Most of the calculations have to do with latitude and longitude.

array.o.js extends the functions for the array object.

string.o.js extends the functions for the string object.

misc.o.js a bunch of miscellaneous functions.
